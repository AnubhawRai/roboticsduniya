        <h3>Introduction</h3>
<a href="#">Purpose:</a> Explore the distinct roles, principles, and applications of robotics and AI.<br>
<a href="#">Background:</a> Define both robotics and AI; introduce how they intersect and differ fundamentally.<br>
<a href="#">Thesis Statement:</a> Though often intertwined, robotics and AI are distinct fields, with robotics focused on physical systems and AI centered around intelligence and decision-making processes.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>1. Definitions and Core Principles</h3><br>
<a href="#">Robotics:</a> Explain robotics as a branch of engineering focused on designing, building, and programming physical machines (robots) to perform specific tasks.<br>
<a href="#">AI:</a>Define AI as the development of algorithms and computational models that enable machines to mimic or exhibit behaviors associated with human intelligence.<br>
<a href="#">Difference in Goals:</a> Robotics aims at physical manipulation in the real world, while AI aims at cognitive abilities, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>2. Historical Background and Evolution</h3><br>
<a href="#">Robotics History:</a> Trace early developments (e.g., Archytas’s mechanical bird, Al-Jazari’s water clock) to industrial and modern robotics (Unimate, autonomous vehicles).<br>
<a href="#">AI History:</a> Outline key moments in AI, from Alan Turing's foundational work to modern machine learning, covering major milestones like symbolic AI, expert systems, and deep learning.<br>
<a href="#">Convergence Points:</a> Mention when AI started being applied to robotics, such as in autonomous robots or drones, and explain why these fields came together.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>3. Overlap and Interdependence</h3><br>
<a href="#">AI-Enabled Robotics:</a> Discuss areas where robotics utilizes AI, such as perception (e.g., computer vision), path planning, object recognition, and autonomous decision-making.<br>
<a href="#">Embodied AI:</a> Explain concepts like embodied intelligence, where AI benefits from physical embodiment in robots to learn about the environment.<br>
<a href="#">Distinct Use Cases vs. Integrated Applications:</a> Highlight autonomous vehicles, drones, and social robots as examples where robotics and AI seamlessly integrate.
<br>
<br>
